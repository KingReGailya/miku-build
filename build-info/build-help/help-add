This command let's you add a new frame to a list

For example in order to add a frame to the default list 

mikub add TYPE Name Image/Name LOCATION

In the TYPE slot put what it's building from such as a git repo or local folder
to specify a git repo put "git" and for a folder put "folder"

In order to add a frame to a custom list use add list to the command

mikub add list LIST-NAME TYPE Name Image/Name LOCATION

Here is the command I used for the Miku Youtube Downloader Site

mikub add list miku-dlp git dlp-site kingregailya/miku-dlp-site https://github.com/KingReGailya/Miku-Dlp-Site.git

This adds a frame named dlp-site to the miku-dlp list building the image kingregailya/miku-dlp-site from this git repo https://github.com/KingReGailya/Miku-Dlp-Site.git
